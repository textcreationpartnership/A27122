         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS for us, our Kingdome is not of this world, and our warfare is not for earthly Crownes, honors or glory, but its ſpiritual and for a Kingdome without end; and our weapons are not carnal but ſpiritual, and mighty through God againſt ſpiritual wickedneſſe in high places, and all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſſe of men, and not againſt their perſons or eſtates outward, (and we are them of whom <hi>Enock</hi> propheſied (the Saints) in whom the Lord God would come to convince all the ungodly of their ungodly deeds and hard ſpeeches, and to execute his Judgments upon them, not by outward Sword to deſtroy Creatures; but by the Sword of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Living God, who is come to deſtroy the works of the Devil.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45946:2"/> violence againſt Creatures, being redeemed up to God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all, who hath made all Nations of men of one blood, that dwell upon the face of the whole Earth, who will rebuke them (even the ſpirit of Enmity and Pride the ground of ſtrife and Wars.) <hi>That they ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hooks, and not Learn War any more Iſa.</hi> 2.4.</p>
            <p>This hath the Lord God by his eternal power, through his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgements, and everlaſting mercys begun among us, who are a poor and afflicted people, whoſe truſt is only in his name, and arme of ſalvation, and not in the arme of Fleſh, for that which truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man and makes fleſh his arme is a curſed as it is written; And this we do faithfully and impartially in ſingleneſs of heart declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole world, that God by his Son in us, which is his power, hath taken away the nature and ground of Wars, ſtrife and violence, and ſubdued it, which ſtood in times paſt between him and us, which hindred the good things, and hid his face from us, even peace, joy and comfort to our immortal ſouls, and hath created in us a new heart, and renewed a right ſpirit, in which we are juſtified in his ſight and preſence, and in which we beare good will to all people, and ſeeks the peace and well being of the bodys and ſouls of all people upon Earth, Jew and Gentile, bond and free, Barbarians, Turks, Indians, Greeks, Romans, Engliſh or any other, God hath made us all of one blood to dwell upon the face of the earth, (Mark) we are all of one blood, all the workmanſhip of one Creator, who hath appointed them times and ſeaſons that they ſhould all ſeek him, (though he be not far from every one of us, as it is written, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26, 27. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.13, <hi>And ſaith the Prophet, he that formed the Mountains and created the Hills ſheweth unto man his thoughts, and they that ſeeks God, ſeeks him that ſearcheth the heart, and tryeth the Reigns, who rebuketh the people and ſtrong Nations that their Swords may be beaten into Plowſhares, and their Spears into Pruning hooks,</hi> (Mark) he rebuks the ſtrong Nations that are in the ſtrife, enmity, and Wars, which is of the Devil the Author of ſtrife, the Murderer and Lyer from the beginning, the deſtroyer of ſouls.</p>
            <p>From whence came wars, and fightings (let Gods witneſs anſwer) came they not from the emnity, Luſts, Pride and ambition, which wars againſt the immortal Soul, and is not he his own ſouls enemy, that lives in the Spirit of enmity againſt God, and them of his fleſh and blood; and is he not in the diſobedience to Chriſt Jeſus, who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45946:3"/> ſaith <hi>Love your Enemies, do good to them that deſpitefully uſe you and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you;</hi> And doth not Gods wrath abide upon the diſobedient and rebellious, who obeys not his Commandments? Let all people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth conſider theſe things, who profeſs Chriſtianity, and ſee if you obey and follow him whom you profeſs in words, who is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but the Devil and his works, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and ground of Strife, Wars and Confuſion, and to guid the feet of all people in the way of peace.</p>
            <p>So this is our principle, not as an Opinion or Judgement which may faile us, or in which may be miſtaks or doubts, but its the infallible ground &amp; unchangeable foundation of our Religion (that is to ſay) Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, that ſpirit, Divine Nature, of way of Life, which God hath raiſed and renewed in us, in which we walk, and in whom we delight to dwell, and cannot but worſhip, and yeild obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto, even him which deſtroys all enmity, and reconciles to himſelf and in himſelf all things in Heaven and Earth, who by his power bringeth down the high looks, lays low the haughtineſs of men (in which is the ground of ſtrife and wars,) and exalts truth and Righteouſneſs in the Earth, even his Kingdome over all, which is an everlaſting Kingdome of peace, into which no uncleane thing, Dogs, Sorcerers, unbeleivers, or Hipocrites can enter, but only them whoſe minds are redeemed from the Earth, and the ſpirit of Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wickedneſs whoſe Robes are waſhed white in the blood of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>So that if any be yet doubtful concerning us, or our principle in this particular, whether we have any ſecret intents or private reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that if we had opportunity we would fight or raiſe outward force of the arm of fleſh for our defence or preſervation, and not any longer ſuffer ſuch grievous oppreſſions and cruel provocations as theſe many years paſt we have undergone with patience, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This we do declare, and that in and by the ſpirit of the Lord, that we are in our meaſures redeemed by the pretious blood of his Son Jeſus Chriſt (the Lamb of God (that takes away the ſin, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles unto him and to all men) from that nature and ſpirit of enmitie from whence the wars and fightings comes, and we are taught, led, and guided by (and are poſſeſſors of a meaſure of the ſame ſpirit of Grace and Truth, that was in that perſon Chriſt our Elder Brother, that ſuffered patiently (the contradictions and falſe accuſations of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) as a Lamb without the Gates of Jeruſalem, of whoſe Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45946:3"/> and life we are eye witneſſes) even of his Majeſty and glory, and the coming of his Kingdome with power (full of grace and truth) ſo that the tree being now made good the fruit is the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit (to wit) wickedneſs, enmity, miſchief, or violence againſt any of the children of men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth: ſo we have not only the name or outward profeſſion of Chriſt in words (as it is in the world) but we are made partakers of a meaſure of the ſame divine nature, and we are now (being regenerated rayſed and renewed into his own image of truth and love, righteouſneſs and peace) his of-ſpring, and he is our God and Father, who rebukes the ſtrong nations, and makes wars to ceaſe to the ends of the earth; Glory and honour be to him in the higheſt over all for ever.</p>
            <p>And now as concerning the objection which ſometimes hath been asked as a queſtion, ſome thinking thereby to enſnare us, <hi>(viz,)</hi> VVhether or no we would fight if the ſpirit ſhould move us, (&amp;c.) To which we anſwer in the fear of God in the truth and ſimplicity of our hearts as it is in Jeſus, that we do really and confidently beleive that the Lord our God (who is that good ſpirit that guids us in all Truth) will never move us to do that or thoſe things again for which he hath rebuked us, and ſmitten us by his righteous Judgements, (and for which he will ſmite and rebuke the ſtrong Nations) and not only ſo, but hath redeemed us from the very root, Nature, Spirit, and ground of the Enmity and curſe from whence the wars and the fightings comes; So that to us, it ſeemeth as impoſſible for us to be found in ſuch things (plottings fightings and violence) as for a good tree to bring forth evil fruit, or for one Fountain to yield ſalt water and freſh, for we have felt Gods rebukes becauſe of that ſtrong nature that dwelt in us, from whence envy, pride, wrath, malice and hart-burnings one againſt another ſprang, and all manner of evil thoughts which defiles men proceeded; the which rebukes, reproofes and juſt judgements of God, have melted and broken our hearts, and taken out the ſtone (the hardneſs) and made them ſoft and tender towards God, and towards all people, and that love is now felt, ſhed abroad in our hearts which thinks no evil, much leſs can we act evill or miſchief againſt any.</p>
            <p>So that our kingdome and glory, delight, joy and peace is not of this world (but we are as ſtrangers in it, as all our Fathers were) for if it had been ſo, we would long ere this have plotted and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45946:4"/> to defend and preſerve our ſelves from theſe many, great and cruel ſufferings, which we theſe many years with patience have borne and endured, and ſhall yet beare and endure all things, in the meaſure of the love and charity which the holy God of all power hath endued us with, and made us partakers of, committing our cauſe and all things concerning us to him that judgeth righteouſly, who will plead for his ſeed with all fleſh, in his own due time and ſeaſon, even in the hearts and conſciences of all his enemies that wrong and abuſe his children; and what is done to us, is done to him, for we are his; and he careth for us.</p>
            <p>And now if any ſubtilty of the Serpent ſhould ariſe in any, and boaſt it ſelf over us, becauſe we have declared the nakedneſs of our hearts, in ſimplicity and truth in Gods ſight, and in the ſight of all people in this perticular, and ſay now they have declared that their principle is not (or leads not to fight) or to deſtroy mens lives, or to reſiſt or ſtrive with fleſh and blood with carnal weapons, &amp;c. But to be patient in whatſoever is laid upon them without plotting, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif, or doing violence againſt any, though it be done to them; Therefore we now may uſe them as we liſt without fear of opoſition or violence again from them for they are ingaged by their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle, not to do violence or plot miſcheif, or ſhed any mans blood, but to indure all in patience whatſoever is ſaid or done againſt them &amp;c.</p>

            <p>For our unchangeable principle is the Royal Law which God hath written in the heart, and is an everlaſting light (the truth) which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man that cometh into the World, which reproves for ſin and tranſgreſſion and the ground of it, and all that live in it (in their own Conſciences,) which lets them ſee their thoughts, words, and Actions, whether they are good or evil, ſetting before all people life and death, and the ways of it, &amp; its their condemnation that diſpiſes the reproofs and are diſobedient unto it, but to them that take heed unto it, love &amp; obey it, it leads them in the ways of righteouſneſs truth and uprightneſs, through the midſt of the paths of Judgments to the Fountain of life and love, in which there is no enmity, but everlaſting ſalvation and peace, where the holy Mountain of the Lord is felt known and witneſſed, in which there is no hurting nor deſtroying, into which God Almighty is gathering his Seed, out of every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on kindred, people, and language upon the earth, that all his people may ſit and live under their own Vine, where none can make them afraid. This is the high-way of holineſs, which God hath prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of all people, into which all that are ſaved muſt walk, (as it is written) in the light of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.5. and in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs is accepted of him, but to the wicked (that deſpiſe his Counſel) God ſaith, <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my words into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>
